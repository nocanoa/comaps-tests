<!--
     A combination of reference points on the opposite carriageway, high offroad cost,
     allowing any road to be used and a low penalty results in a completely incorrect
     location (through a residential area rather than along the opposite carriageway).
     Test case for turn penalty (eastern end) if the above is resolved.
