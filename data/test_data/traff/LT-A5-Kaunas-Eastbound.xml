<!--
    This is a 140 m location. Reference points are almost exactly on the opposite
    carriageway; since this is inside a junction, there is a wider gap between
    the two carriageways than there would be on a normal stretch of expressway.
    Without truncation, the decoded location starts approximately in the right
    spot but overshoots the end point, going to the nearest junction, then back
    in the opposite direction and to the end point on the opposite carriageway,
    ending within 5 m of the end point.
