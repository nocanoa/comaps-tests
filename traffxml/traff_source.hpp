/**
 * @brief Abstract base class for TraFF sources.
 *
 * Subclasses encapsulate various forms of TraFF sources. The base class provides methods for
 * subscription management, message retrieval and service status.
 *
 * Any `TraffSource` method may call `TrafficManager` methods exposed through the
 * `TraffSourceManager` interface. The traffic manager must therefore ensure there is no conflict
 * between thread-synchronization mechanisms held when calling a `TraffSource` method and those
 * which may get requested when that method calls a `TraffSourceManager` method.
 *
 * Each subclass should implement a non-public constructor (private if the subclass is final,
 * protected otherwise) and a public factory method. The factory method takes the same arguments
 * as the constructor, creates an instance wrapped in a `std::unique_ptr` and registers it with
 * the `TraffSourceManager`. It can be implemented as follows:
 * ```
 * void SomeTraffSource::Create(TraffSourceManager & manager, SomeOtherArg & otherArg)
 * {
 *   std::unique_ptr<SomeTraffSource> source = std::unique_ptr<SomeTraffSource>(new SomeTraffSource(manager, otherArg));
 *   manager.RegisterSource(std::move(source));
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Each subclass must provide implementations for `Subscribe()`, `ChangeSubscription()`,
 * `Unsubscribe()`, `IsPollNeeded()` and `Poll()`.
 *
 * Most of these methods can be called from any thread, including the UI thread (see documentation
 * of individual methods for details). This has two implications:
 *
 * Subclasses must ensure thread safety for methods they implement, in particular regarding access
 * to shared members. This can be done by locking `m_mutex`.
 *
 * Also, methods should not block or perform lengthy operations. Network operations must be
 * delegated to a separate thread (attempting a network operation on the UI thread will cause the
 * application to be killed on Android).
 *
 * This class provides various protected members which subclasses can build upon. These include a
 * reference to the `TraffSourceManager`, a mutex for thread-safe access, a subscription ID,
 * timestamps for the last request and response, as well as for the next request, a retry count
 * for failed operations, and an indication of a pending request.

   *
   * `OK` changes the status from `Unknown`, or any error which would be resolved by the last
   * operation, to `IsAvailable`.
   *
   * `INVALID` indicates a condition which should be treated as a bug, either in the source or its

   *
   * `SUBSCRIPTION_UNKNOWN` should be handled by clearing the subscription ID and resubscribing,
   * then setting the status based on the result of the new subscription.
   *
   * `INTERNAL_ERROR` changes the status to `Error`.
   *
   * If the source does not seem to be connected to a valid backend (e.g. if a HTTP source responds
   * with an HTTP error), the status should be changed to `Error`.
   *
   * If a TraFF `GET_CAPABILITIES` request returns a minimum version higher than supported by this
   * application, the status should be changed to `ExpiredApp` and no further requests to the source
