/**
 * @brief Retrieves a TraFF feed from an XML document.
 *
 * The document must conform loosely to the TraFF specification (currently version 0.8).
 *
 * The name of the root element is not verified, but the `message` elements must be its immediate
 * children.
 *
 * Values which cannot be parsed correctly are skipped.
 *
 * Events whose event type does not match their event class are skipped.
 *
 * Messages, events, locations or points which lack mandatory information are skipped.
 *
 * If children are skipped but the parent remains valid, parsing it will report success.
 *
 * Parsing the feed will report failure if all its messages fail to parse, but not if it has no
 * messages.
 *
 * In addition to the TraFF specification, we also use a custom extension, `mwm_coloring`, which is
 * a child of `message` and holds decoded traffic coloring. In order to parse it, `dataSource` must
 * be specified. If `dataSource` is `nullopt`, coloring will be ignored. It is recommended to pass
 * `dataSource` if, and only if, parsing an XML stream that is expected to contain traffic coloring.
 * This is only expected to occur in cached data. TraFF from external sources is not expected to
 * contain `mwm_coloring` elements and souch information should be ignored in feeds from outside.
 *
 * @note To pass a reference to the framework data source (assuming the `framework` is the framework
 * instance), use `std::cref(framework.GetDataSource())`.
 *
 * @note Custom elements and attributes which are not part of the TraFF specification, other than
 * `mwm_coloring`, are ignored.
 *
 * @param document The XML document from which to retrieve the messages.
 * @param dataSource The data source for coloring, see description.
 * @param feed Receives the TraFF feed.
 * @return `true` on success, `false` on failure.
